## Team Members

## Overview
This project explores the convergence times of Gossip and Push-Sum algorithms across different network topologies. We implemented failure models to simulate real-world conditions where nodes or connections might fail.

## What is Working
Gossip Algorithm: Successfully implemented and tested across Full, Line, 3D Grid, and Imperfect 3D Grid topologies.
Push-Sum Algorithm: Successfully implemented and tested across Full, Line, 3D Grid, and Imperfect 3D Grid topologies.
Graphical Analysis: Plots generated to visualize convergence times relative to network size.

## Graphical Results
Convergence Time - Full Topology
These plots illustrate the convergence times for both algorithms across different network sizes and topologies, highlighting the scalability and performance differences.
